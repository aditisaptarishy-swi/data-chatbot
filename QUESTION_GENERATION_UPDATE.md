# AI-Powered Question Generation Update

## Overview
Updated the schema-based question generation system to use AI for creating natural, human-like questions instead of robotic technical ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. New AI Service Method (`src/utils/aiService.ts`)

Added `generateNaturalQuestions()` method that:
- Takes database schema as input
- Sends schema context to AI API with specific prompt
- Generates 5 simple, conversational questions
- Filters out complex or technical questions
- Falls back to smart default questions if AI fails

**Key Features:**
- Questions limited to 15 words or less
- Filters out technical jargon (table, column, schema, database)
- Validates questions are business-focused
- Handles streaming AI responses
- Graceful error handling with fallback

### 2. Updated ChatInterface Component (`src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`)

Modified welcome message generation to:
- Show loading state while generating questions
- Call AI service asynchronously
- Display AI-generated questions in welcome message
- Handle errors gracefully with fallback questions

### 3. Improved Fallback Questions

Enhanced fallback question generation to:
- Analyze table names for context
- Generate relevant business questions
- Keep questions simple and under 10 words
- Provide contextual questions based on data type

## Example Transformations

### Before (Robotic):
- ❌ "Show me all records from DEALERS"
- ❌ "What is the average DealerID from DEALERS?"
- ❌ "Count the total number of records in DEALERS"

### After (Natural):
- ✅ "How many dealers do we have?"
- ✅ "Show me recent dealers"
- ✅ "What are the totals?"
- ✅ "Show me by location"
- ✅ "Show me the top results"

## AI Prompt Strategy

The AI prompt emphasizes:
1. **Simplicity**: Keep questions under 10 words
2. **Natural Language**: Use everyday business terms
3. **No Technical Terms**: Avoid table/column names
4. **Business Focus**: Questions managers would ask
5. **Clear Examples**: Show good vs bad questions

## Error Handling

- AI API failures → Use smart fallback questions
- No response → Use generic fallback questions
- Complex questions → Filter out automatically
- Technical terms → Filter out automatically

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Questions sound natural and conversational
2. **Context-Aware**: Questions relevant to actual schema
3. **Fast**: Async loading with immediate feedback
4. **Reliable**: Multiple fallback layers
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized question generation logic
